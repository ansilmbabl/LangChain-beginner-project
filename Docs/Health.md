# Creating the `Health` Class (3/5)

In this guide, we'll explain the code that creates the `Health` class in the `chain.py` file. The `Health` class is a fundamental part of the project, responsible for initializing the environment, connecting to OpenAI, and providing essential functionality for the Streamlit frontend.

## Overview of the `Health` Class

The `Health` class is designed to provide health-related information and YouTube video recommendations. It utilizes the `langchain` [[1]](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) library and interacts with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for generating responses.

Let's break down the code step by step:

```python
import re
import os
from Chains.secretkey import openai_api_key

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SequentialChain
from langchain.tools import YouTubeSearchTool

```

### Importing Required Libraries and Modules

The code begins by importing the following libraries and modules, each of which serves a specific purpose in the project, we'll see that in the coming sessions:

  - `re`: This library provides support for regular expressions. Used for handling [Youtube video Links]((Docs\youtube_video.md) ) on specific format, we will see that later [[2]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ)

  - `os`: The `os` module provides a way to interact with the operating system. In this code, it's used to set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable. [[3]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os)

  - `from Chains.secretkey import openai_api_key`: This import statement brings in the `openai_api_key` variable, which is stored in `secretkey.py` file. The OpenAI API key is essential for authentication when interacting with OpenAI's services. We've already seen this [here](Docs\secretkey.md)

  - `from langchain.llms import OpenAI`: Here, the `OpenAI` class from the LangChain library is imported. It is used to interact with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model. [[4]](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/openai)

  - `from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate`: It helps create templates for generating prompts to query the language model. [[5]](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/#prompt-template)

  - `from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SequentialChain`: These chains are used to structure and manage the flow of data in the project. [[6]](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/llm_chain) [[7]](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/sequential_chains#sequential-chain)

  - `from langchain.tools import YouTubeSearchTool`:  `YouTubeSearchTool` class from the LangChain library is used to search for relevant YouTube videos based on user input. [[8]](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/youtube)

### `Health` Class Initialization
The `Health` class acts as a bridge between the frontend and LangChain/OpenAI in our project.

```python
class Health:
    def __init__(self, age, sex, language) -> None:
        os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = openai_api_key
        self.llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.1, max_tokens=256)
        self.youtube_vid = YouTubeSearchTool()
        self.age = age
        self.sex = sex
        self.language = language
```

In the `__init__` method, it initializes several crucial components:

- `openai_api_key`: The OpenAI API key used to authenticate and access OpenAI services through environment variable.
- `llm`: An instance of the OpenAI language model (`OpenAI`) with specific settings such as temperature and max tokens. we can set other parameters also for fine tuning. [[9]](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain.llms.openai.OpenAI.html)
- `youtube_vid`: An instance of the `YouTubeSearchTool` for searching YouTube videos. [[10]](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain.tools.youtube.search.YouTubeSearchTool.html)
- `age`, `sex`, and `language`: User input parameters passed during class initialization, which are essential for generating health tips and recommendations tailored to the user. We'll see how this implemented in the next [section](Docs\health_tips.md).

## Conclusion

This guide has explained the initial part of the `chain.py` file, which defines the `Health` class. This class plays a pivotal role in connecting the Streamlit frontend with LangChain and OpenAI to provide health tips and YouTube video recommendations.

By understanding the purpose of the imported libraries and the initialization of the `Health` class, you'll have a solid foundation for comprehending how this project leverages LangChain and OpenAI to provide valuable content to users.

In the next guide, we will delve deeper into the `Health` class and its methods, which fetch health tips and YouTube videos based on user input.
